Landsat data is provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) through direct reception of the data at Geoscience Australias satellite reception facility or download. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture and ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC\_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments.

This product is the result of a collaboration between Geoscience Australia, the University of Aberyswyth, CSIRO, the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network.
