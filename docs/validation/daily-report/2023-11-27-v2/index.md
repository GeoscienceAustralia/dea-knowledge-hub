## Results

The surface reflectance statistics collected on this day are grouped into bands.
This allows the data to be used to validate Geoscience Australia's other datasets
which use the same standardised bands.

:::{figure} ./RGB-2023-11-27.png

A satellite imagery tile of true colour (RGB) surface reflectance. It covers an
area of approximately 2&nbsp;km &times; 2&nbsp;km. The white box indicates the size and location
of the field site.

:::{figure} ./DayComparison-2023-11-27.png

A band-by-band plot of surface reflectance for satellite and field data.
Satellite uncertainty error bars for each band are the standard deviation of
pixel values over and surrounding the field site. Field uncertainty error bars
are the standard deviation of values after averaging all spectra within the same
satellite pixels.

:::{figure} ./OverallComparison-2023-11-27.png

A plot of Satellite Surface Reflectance versus Field Site Surface Reflectance on this day.
The solid line represents the one-to-one equality between field and satellite measurements.
The black dots are the values from all field site measurements prior to this date. 
The line of best fit is not shown, but its parameters are given in the bottom-right corner.
