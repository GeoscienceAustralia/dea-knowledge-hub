## About

A Multi-scale topographic position image of Australia has been generated by combining a topographic position index and topographic ruggedness. Topographic Position Index (TPI) measures the topographic slope position of landforms. Ruggedness informs on the roughness of the surface and is calculated as the standard deviation of elevations. The derived ternary image captures variations in topographic position across these spatial scales (blue local, green intermediate and red regional) and gives a rich representation of nested landform features that have broad application in understanding geomorphological and hydrological processes and in mapping regolith and soils over the Australian continent.
