## About

The 1 second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Models Version 1.0 package comprises three surface models: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the Smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM-S) and the Hydrologically Enforced Digital Elevation Model (DEM-H). The DEMs were derived from the SRTM data acquired by NASA in February 2000.
