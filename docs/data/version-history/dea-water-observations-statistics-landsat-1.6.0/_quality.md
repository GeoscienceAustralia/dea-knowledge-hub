## Accuracy

Please refer to the Landsat Surface Reflectance Product Description for the accuracy and limitations of the atmospheric, BRDF and topographic shading processing sequence. Please refer to Mueller et al. 2016 for details on the accuracy and limitations of Water Observations from Space (WOfS and WOfS-STATS).

WO-STATS provides a summary of water classification results from the WOfS product for all of Australia. As it cannot perfectly filter out misclassifications due to clouds, cloud shadows and issues to do with satellite sensor problems (such as the Landsat 7 SLC-Off failure), the summary also contains these misclassifications. In general misclassifications occur in the very low frequency observations and so can cause a misrepresentation of flooded areas. Misclassifications can also be caused by the presence of vegetation covering the water or within the water.
