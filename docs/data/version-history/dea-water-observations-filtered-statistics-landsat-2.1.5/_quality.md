## Accuracy

Please refer to the SR-N\_25\_2.0.0 Product Description (GA, 2013) for the accuracy and limitations of the atmospheric, BRDF and topographic shading processing sequence. Please refer to Mueller et al. 2016 for details on the accuracy and limitations of WOfS, WOfS-STATS and WOfS-FILT-STATS.

WO-FILT-STATS provides a filtered summary of water classification results from the WOfS product for all of Australia. As WOfS cannot perfectly filter out misclassifications due to clouds, cloud shadows and issues to do with satellite sensor problems (such as the Landsat 7 SLC-Off failure), the summary also contains these misclassifications. In general misclassifications occur in the very low frequency observations and so can cause a misrepresentation of flooded areas. The confidence filtering process in WO-FILT-STATS reduces the noise displayed in the Water Summary, making it easier to understand for the general user.

## Quality assurance

The quality of WOfS-FILTERED-STATS is verified by visual inspection, to find instances of processing failure or issues relating to upstream data quality issues. Any detected issues are related to the DEA Pipeline and Core teams for checking and rectification.
