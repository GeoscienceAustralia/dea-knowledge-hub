### QA enumeration 

To assist with the downstream calculation of the [DEA Mangrove Canopy Cover](/data/product/dea-mangrove-canopy-cover-landsat/) product, each pixel has an additional enumeration associated with it: 

:::{list-table}

* - **0**
  - Not enough observations to calculate percentiles (less than 3 clear and dry observations), and there is at least one observation that has been identified as wet. Defined in ODC configuration as: insufficient observations wet. 
* - **1**
  - Not enough observations to calculate percentiles (less than 3 clear and dry observations), but never identified as wet. Defined in ODC configuration as: insufficient observations dry. 
* - **2**
  - There are sufficient observations to compute percentiles (3 or more clear and dry observations). Defined in ODC configuration as: sufficient observations

This enumeration assists in quantifying uncertainty within the [DEA Mangrove Canopy Cover](/data/product/dea-mangrove-canopy-cover-landsat/) (see Mangrove Canopy Cover definition). 

### Side car files 

Collection 3 Fractional Cover Percentiles will be accompanied by the following metadata, presentation and quality assurance side car files:
