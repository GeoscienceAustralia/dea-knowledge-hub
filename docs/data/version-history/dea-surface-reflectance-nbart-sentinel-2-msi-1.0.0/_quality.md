## Accuracy

Atmospheric correction accuracy is dependent on the quality of aerosol data available to determine the atmospheric profile at time of image acquisition.

BRDF correction is based on low resolution imagery (MODIS) which is assumed to be relevant to medium resolution imagery such as Sentinel-2 MSI. BRDF correction is applied to each whole Sentinel 2 MSI tiles and does not account for changes in land cover. It also excludes effects due to topographic shading and local BRDF. This algorithm is dependent on the availability of relevant MODIS BRDF data.

Topographic shading correction algorithm is designed for medium resolution imagery and assumes that hill slopes are resolved by the sensor system (Li et al., 2012). The algorithm assumes that: a. BRDF effect for inclined surfaces is modelled by the surface slope and does not account for land cover orientation relative to gravity (as occurs for some broad leaf vegetation with vertical leaf orientation).

## Quality assurance

### Atmospheric and BRDF Correction

The algorithm was validated using Landsat data. As detailed in Li et al. (2010), the atmospheric and BRDF correction algorithm was validated in three parts:

1. Validate combined atmospheric and surface BRDF correction using field reflectance measurements at two very different sites, Gwydir, NSW, and Lake Frome, SA - correlation (measured as r) between corrected image values and field data was >0.95.
2. Validate surface BRDF correction using data from image overlap areas of adjacent paths acquired one week apart in northeast Queensland - normalised reflectance factor was very close in corrected images, but not in original images, and difference in reflectance factor values between corrected and uncorrected images can be >0.05.
3. Cross-validate Landsat TM data for accuracy of spectral reflectance using the MODIS reflectance product for Lake Frome correlation (measured as r2) between corrected Landsat TM image values and MODIS reflectance product was 0.93-0.97 in all bands except Landsat TM band 5, which was 0.90.

The results clearly show that the algorithm can remove most of the BRDF effect without empirical adjustment and that cross-calibration between the Landsat ETM+ and MODIS sensors is achievable.

### Topographic Correction

The algorithm was validated using Landsat data. As detailed in Li et al. (2012), two high relief areas in southeast Australia (Australian Alps in northeast Victoria and the Blue Mountains in NSW) were used to test the algorithm against eight Landsat images with varying solar angles (seasons), and terrain types. Validation included four parts.

1. Visual assessment showed that the algorithm removed much of the topographic effect and detected deep shadows in all eight images.
2. An indirect validation based on the change in correlation between the data and terrain slope showed that the correlation coefficient between the surface reflectance factor and the cosine of the incident (sun) angle reduced dramatically after the topographic correction algorithm was applied. The correlation coefficient typically reduced from 0.80-0.70 to 0.05 in areas of significant relief.
3. Validated using land cover classification. The corrected surface reflectance can provide suitable input data for multi-temporal land cover classification in areas of high relief based on spectral signatures and spectral albedo, while the products based only on BRDF and atmospheric correction cannot.
4. Compared with two empirical methods based on the C-correction were used as well as the established sun-canopy-sensor SCS-method to provide benchmarks. The proposed method was found to achieve the same (better) measures of shade reduction without empirical regression.
