## Changelog

ITEM v2.0 has implemented an improved tidal modelling framework (see Sagar et al. 2018 and Processing Step: Create a continental scale tidal modelling framework) over that utilised in ITEM v1.0. The expanded Landsat archive within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) has also enabled the model extent (Figure 1) to be increased to cover a number of offshore reefs, including the full Great Barrier Reef and southern sections of the Torres Strait Islands. 

The DEA archive and new tidal modelling framework has improved the coverage and quality of the ITEM v2.0 relative extents model, particularly in regions where AGDC cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0 produced discontinuities or the imposed v1.0 cell structure resulted in poor quality tidal modelling (see Sagar et al. 2017).

Examples of regions in ITEM v2.0 where these significant improvements have been noted include:

* **Dampier Peninsula and King Sound, WA**. Improved modelling within King Sound has removed the discontinuities seen at cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0, and expanded the extent of intertidal region being mapped.
* **Tiwi Islands, Coburg Pensinsula and Croker Island, NT**. Poor spatial representation of the regions tidal regimes in  ITEM v1.0 has been improved in v2.0 resulting in extensive onshore reefs and mudflats now being mapped. 
* The full **Great Barrier Reef** has been mapped, detailing reef structures which expose at low tide. Algorithm amendments have reduced the false positive exposed surface detections resulting from glint and sun glitter.
* **Broad Sound, QLD.** Improved tidal modelling has resulted in a smoother intertidal extent map, and a greatly improved confidence layer value for the region.
* Improvements in the coverage of the DEA archive has allowed many regions unresolved in ITEM v1.0 and showing as 'no data' to be modelled successfully in ITEM 2.0. For example, **Mornington Island, QLD, Eastern sections of Fraser Island, QLD** and pensinsulas in **Bowling Green Bay National Park near Townsville, QLD.**
