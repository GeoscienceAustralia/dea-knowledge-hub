## Background

Intertidal zones are those which are exposed to the air at low tide and underwater at high tide. These include sandy beaches, tidal flats, rocky shores and reefs. 

Intertidal zones form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms, but are faced with increasing threats, including coastal erosion and a rise in sea levels.  

Accurate knowledge of the extent and topography of these regions can help assess where these threats will have the greatest impact, and provide essential information to underpin monitoring and management strategies. This data is challenging to acquire using traditional survey methods given the dynamic nature of intertidal zones and length of the Australian coastline.

## What this product offers

This product is a national dataset of the exposed intertidal zone: the land between the observed highest and lowest tide. It provides the extent and topography of the intertidal zone of Australia's coastline (excluding off-shore Territories).

This information was collated using observations in the Landsat archive since 1986. This product can be a valuable complementary dataset to both onshore LiDAR survey data and coarser offshore bathymetry data, enabling a more realistic representation of the land and ocean interface.

## Technical information

The Intertidal Extents Model product is a national scale gridded dataset characterising the spatial extents of the exposed intertidal zone, at intervals of the observed tidal range (Sagar et al. 2017). The current version (2.0) utilises all Landsat observations (5, 7, and 8) for Australian coastal regions (excluding off-shore Territories) between 1986 and 2016 (inclusive).

### Datasets

The Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM v2.0) consists of three datasets derived from the Landsat NBAR data managed in Digital Earth Australia for the period 1986 to 2016

#### Dataset 1: ITEM v2.0 TIDAL MODEL

The `ITEMv2_tidalmodel.shp` identifies the location and extents of the 306 polygons (Figure 1) used in the product, defined by the Continental Scale tidal modelling framework (see Processing Step: Create a continental scale tidal modelling framework). The shapefile also includes information on the lowest (LOT) and highest (HOT) observed tides for the cell, and hence the observed tidal range (HOT-LOT), based on tidal modelling for the time of acquisition of each of the corresponding Landsat observations in the cell polygon.

The dataset consists of 306 raster files (NETCDF and Geotiff) corresponding to polygons of the continental scale tidal model.

#### Dataset 3: THE CONFIDENCE LAYER v2.0

The **Confidence Layer (item\_v2\_conf)** reflects the confidence level of the Relative Extents Model, based on the distribution of classification metrics (see Processing Step: Calculate NDWI for each Observation) within each of the percentile intervals of the tidal range. The layer should be used to filter region/pixels in the model where the derived spatial extents may be adversely affected by data and modelling errors. The dataset consists of 306 raster files (NETCDF and Geotiff) corresponding to polygons of the continental scale tidal model.

## Lineage

The Intertidal Extents Model product analyses GA’s historic archive of satellite imagery to derive a model of the spatial extents of the intertidal zone throughout the tidal cycle. The model can assist in understanding the relative elevation profile of the intertidal zone, delineating exposed areas at differing tidal heights and stages.

The product differs from previous methods used to map the intertidal zone which have been predominately focused on analysing a small number of individual satellite images per location (e.g Ryu et al., 2002; Murray et al., 2012). By utilising a full 30 year time series of observations, the methodology enables us to overcome the requirement for clear, high quality observations acquired concurrent to the time of high and low tide.

## Processing steps

### 1. Create a continental scale tidal modelling framework
Create a continental scale tidal modelling framework utilising continental scale tidal prediction software developed by Oregon State University (OTPS, Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010). OTPS tide heights were attributed to Landsat observations in the DEA at corresponding times and dates, per location

The modelling process utilises continental scale tidal prediction software developed by Oregon State University (OTPS, Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010). OTPS tide heights were attributed to Landsat observations in the DEA at corresponding times and dates, per location.

To account for geographic and seasonal variations in tidal regimes and ranges, twelve tidal height rasters of the study region at 1km resolution were created utilising the OTPS model, at a randomly selected monthly epoch across a full year. Utilising these raster layers, the tidal modelling spatial framework was constructed with the following steps:

* Perform a multi-resolution segmentation using eCognition software, utilising all twelve tidal height inputs, to create a spatial representation of the multi-epoch tidal variation across the continent.
* Extract the centroids of the object segments created in eCognition and generate a Voronoi Polygon tessellation of the region.
* Perform a visual assessment and manual adjustment of the Voronoi polygon boundaries and nodes to ensure alignment with natural boundaries and coastal/island features.

Through this process, the coastal zone is divided into Voronoi polygons that capture the tidal complexity of the Australian coast, with areas of complex tidal behaviour represented using smaller polygons. The nodes of the polygons can then be used for the tidal attribution process as described in Sagar et al., (2017).

### 2. Apply the Oregon State University tidal model to coastline cells/polygons
The Oregon State University Tidal Prediction Software (OTPS) TPX08 Atlas Model is applied to each coastal cell, to model tidal heights (MSL) at the nominated cell centroid or node location.

### 3. Attribute coastal cells with a tidal height
All observations within the nominated cell/polygon and time period is attributed with a tidal height, relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL), corresponding to the time of observation acquisition and derived cell/polygon centroid or node.

### 4. Sort time series of observations based on tidal height
The time-series of observations for each cell/polygon is then sorted based on the modeled tidal height, and split into subsets representing percentile intervals of the observed tidal range (OTR) for that cell/polygon.

### 5. Mask tile observations for pixel quality
Each tile observation is masked for pixel quality based on the DEA PQA layer to exclude pixels flagged for cloud, band saturation and contiguity.

### 6. Calculate NDWI for each observation
The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) (McFeeters, 1996) is calculated for each observation, and a pixel based median NDWI composite derived for each percentile interval of the cell’s OTR. The pixel-based standard deviation of NDWI values within each percentile interval is also recorded for use in the Confidence Layer.

### 7. Create binary NDWI layers and combine to create Relative Extents Model
Binary Land/Water layers are created from the NDWI composites for each tidal interval using a standard threshold. These are then combined to create the Relative Extents Model. For full methodology and process details see Sagar et al. 2017.
