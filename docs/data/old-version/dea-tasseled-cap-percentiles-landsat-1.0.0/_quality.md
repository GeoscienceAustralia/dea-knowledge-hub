## Accuracy

As an 'index' this does not have any 'accuracy' as distinct from the 'accuracy' of the input surface reflectance. 

In terms of limitations, caution should be used, especially with the Tasseled Cap wetness index results in areas where residual terrain shadow, or dark soils can cause high 'wetness' index values. 

One of the limitations of using the Tasseled Cap wetness index is that it will identify all 'wet' things, including potential wetlands, groundwater dependent ecosystems, irrigated crops/pasture, man-made water storages and sewerage treatment, and does not discriminate between these. As such it should be used in conjunction with other contextual data to ensure that features identified using the Tasseled Cap Wetness Percentiles are features of interest rather than false positives.
