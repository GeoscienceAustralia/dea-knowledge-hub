    caption: Time series of the change in the percentage of total surface area observed as water for waterbody ID r6f07ug9r_v1. The corresponding false colour imagery is shown for three time steps, showing the relationship between the time series and the raw imagery.
  - file: /2021-12/PP-2909-2.jpg
    caption: Conceptualisation of the time series extraction for each polygon. At each individual time step, the percentage surface area of water within each waterbody polygon (outlined in red) was calculated, producing a time series (d) of the change in surface water extent for each waterbody over the last 32 years.
  - file: /2021-12/NationalCaseStudy.jpg
    caption: National-scale seasonal wet area statistics. The bar chart at the top indicates the total wet surface area, the total dry surface area, and the total area of polygon waterbodies that was unobserved for all waterbodies. The maps indicate the spatial pattern of the percentage of each waterbody’s surface wet area at selected time steps. The data gap in 2011/12 occurs between the Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 missions.
