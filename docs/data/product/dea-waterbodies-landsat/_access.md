:::{dropdown} How to view the map

DEA Waterbodies can be viewed on the DEA Maps tool, making it easy to explore and interact with the data. To get started, open [DEA Waterbodies on DEA Maps](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/#share=s-gMICb0o03KwPHyXV52ivMtedIrd).

Or, you can manually add the DEA Waterbodies layer to DEA Maps:

1. Open [DEA Maps](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au).
1. Click **Explore map data**.
1. Select **Inland water** > **DEA Waterbodies** > **DEA Waterbodies (version 3.0)**. 
1. Click **Add to the map**, or the **+** symbol to add the data to the map.
1. You will now see the waterbodies overlaid on the map.

:::{dropdown} How to view more information about a waterbody

On the map, you can click any identified waterbody to view more information about it.

1. Click a waterbody and a pop-up window will appear. This contains important information about the waterbody and a preview of its ‘Pc Wet’ time series.
1. In the pop-up, click the **Expand** button. A more detailed time series chart will open below (and, the waterbody will be added to the left sidebar).
1. The time series chart is composed of dots representing valid observations in the data set, and straight lines are drawn between these dots.
1. There are two time series available for each waterbody, and you can choose to view either or both. In the left sidebar, enable or disable the checkboxes for Pc Wet and Px Wet:
    * **Pc Wet** &mdash; The ‘percentage of total surface area observed as wet’. This is the percentage of the total surface area of the waterbody that has been classified as ‘wet’ for each time step. (Note that this is not a volume.)
    * **Px Wet** &mdash; The ‘Wet Pixel Count’. This is the total number of pixels that have been classified as ‘wet’ for each time step. This value is useful if you need to calculate an area of wet pixels, since each pixel is 30 m × 30 m.
