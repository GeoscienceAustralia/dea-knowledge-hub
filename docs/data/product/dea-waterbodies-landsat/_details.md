## Background

DEA Waterbodies provides up-to-date information about the extent and location of surface water in Australia to enable us to understand this valuable and increasingly scarce resource.

The product uses Geoscience Australia’s archive of over 30 years of Landsat satellite imagery to identify the locations of over 300,000 waterbodies in the Australian landscape and also estimates the wet surface area within these waterbodies.

DEA Waterbodies applies a [water classification](/data/product/dea-water-observations-landsat/) to each available Landsat satellite image and maps the locations of waterbodies across Australia. It provides a time series of wet surface area for all waterbodies that are present more than 10% of the time between 1987 and 2020, and are larger than 2,700 m<sup>2</sup> (the size of 3 Landsat pixels).

The tool indicates changes in the wet surface area of waterbodies over time. This can be used to identify when waterbodies are increasing or decreasing in wet surface area.

% ## Data description

## Applications

* Understand surface water dynamics over time on a local or national scale.
* Provide supporting information to facilitate better water management across Australia.
* Gain insights into the severity and spatial distribution of drought.
* Identify potential water sources for aerial firefighting.
* Get deeper insight into [DEA Water Observations](/data/product/dea-water-observations-landsat/) data.

## Technical information

The DEA Waterbodies product is comprised of two key components:
* **Mapped waterbody outlines** — a polygon dataset of the programmatically generated waterbody outlines.
* **Surface area timeseries** — a CSV timeseries for each polygon of its surface area over time within the mapped polygon (for every available, clear Landsat observation).

The code used in the development of this product is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-conflux).

#### Notes

\* Scene data is available approximately two weeks from the satellite overpass for the Water Observations feature layers used to process Waterbodies. Waterbodies scenes are processed as Water Observations feature layer scenes become available in the DEA datacube. It takes approximately 10 minutes to process Waterbodies per scene.  One Landsat scene measures approximately 190 x 180 km. <https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/landsat_9_fast_facts.pdf>

\*\* Larger waterbodies are easier to detect and smaller or narrower waterbodies are harder to detect. Area estimates should be compared to additional data for verification.

\*\*\* Data fields empty in shapefile (`dt_wetobs`, `wet_sa_m2`, `dt_satpass`, `dt_updated`) are available for the latest relevant observations only via DEA Maps and WMS.

\^ Data fields introduced in v3.0 are ‘New’.

## Lineage 

This product is based on [DEA Water Observations](/data/product/dea-water-observations-landsat/) which it extends with reanalysis and mapping.

### Producing DEA Waterbodies polygons

DEA Waterbodies is a polygon-based view of DEA Water Observations (DEA WO), derived through the automatic processing of DEA WO to identify the outlines of persistent waterbodies across Australia.

For a detailed discussion of the methods used to produce DEA Waterbodies v1, refer to [Krause et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13081437). For the differences between DEA Waterbodies v1, v2 and v3.0, refer to the [Changelog](./?tab=history#changelog). DEA Waterbodies v3.0 uses the same polygon/vector outlines as DEA Waterbodies v2, with additional metadata.
