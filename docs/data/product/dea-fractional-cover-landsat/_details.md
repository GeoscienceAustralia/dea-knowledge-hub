## Background

Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition.

This information is used by policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.

## What this product offers

Fractional Cover (FC), developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program, is a measurement that splits the landscape into three parts, or fractions:
* green (leaves, grass, and growing crops)
* brown (branches, dry grass or hay, and dead leaf litter)
* bare ground (soil or rock)

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) uses Fractional Cover to characterise every 30 m square of Australia for any point in time from 1986 to today.

% ## Data description

## Applications

Fractional cover provides valuable information for a range of environmental and agricultural applications, including:
* soil erosion monitoring
* land surface process modelling
* land management practices (e.g. crop rotation, stubble management, rangeland management)
* vegetation studies
* fuel load estimation
* ecosystem modelling
* land cover mapping

## Technical information

Fractional Cover (FC) provides information about the the proportions of green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.), and bare soils for every 30m x 30m ground footprint across the whole Australian continent. This information is available for every cloud free satellite observation over Australia from 1986 till now. FC can potentially provide insights into the interplay and changes in areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil as well as allowing the mapping of green vegetation extent.

The FC algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8 and 9) acquired since 1986. It is calculated from terrain corrected surface reflectance (DEA Surface Reflectance).

### Data layers

The product consists of four data layers:
* The fractional cover of green vegetation (PV): Fraction of green cover including green groundcover and green leaf material over all strata, within the Landsat pixel, as percentages
* The fractional cover of non-green vegetation (NPV): Fraction of non green cover including litter, dead leaf and branches over all strata, within the Landsat pixel, as percentages
* The fractional cover of bare soil (BS): Fraction of bare ground including rock, bare and disturbed soil, within the Landsat pixel as percentages
* The fractional cover unmixing error (UE): Eclidean Norm of the Residual Vector

The values for this product are scaled as follows:  
* For the fractional cover bands (PV, NPV, BS)  
* 0-100 = fractional cover values that range between 0 and 100%

Due to model uncertainties and the limitations of the training data, some areas may show cover values in excess of 100%.  These areas can either be excluded or treated as equivalent to 100%

### Processing steps

Fractional cover is processed using the Landsat Surface Reflectance archive, and requires green, red, nir, swir1 and swir2 bands. [Fractional Cover Code Repository](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/fc/tree/master) 
 
The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For more information, see Scarth et al. (2010) and Schmidt et al. (2010), and a brief description of the FC algorithm on the [TERN website](https://portal.tern.org.au/metadata/22026).

The bare soil, green vegetation and non-green vegetation end members used for fractional cover can be found here, and was last updated on the 9th of June 2017:  [End members](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/fc/blob/93f66062df0c5110b49d4ae444d726a90619c9fd/fc/endmembers.py#L51)

For the unmixing error (UE) band, the values are scaled between 0 and 127. High unmixing error values represent areas of high model uncertainty (areas of water, cloud, cloud shadow or soil types/colours that were not included in the model training data).

Landsat 8 and 9 OLI have different relative spectral response curves to the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. To account for this a spectral band adjustment factor is applied to the Landsat 8 and 9 data to make it more similar to reflectance as measured by Landsat 7.

% ## Software

## Lineage

While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture - ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional field data has enabled the calibration/validation to extend to the entire Australian continent.

1390 field data sites were used to train the model, and a separate 1565 sites were used to evaluate the model accuracy.

FC was made possible by the collaborative framework established by the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)](http://www.tern.org.au) through the [National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris) and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments.
