## About

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Fractional Cover splits landscape observation data into three parts — or fractions — enabling measurement of green (leaves, grass, and growing crops), brown (branches, dry grass or hay, and dead leaf litter), and bare ground (soil or rock) in any area of Australia at any time since 1986.
