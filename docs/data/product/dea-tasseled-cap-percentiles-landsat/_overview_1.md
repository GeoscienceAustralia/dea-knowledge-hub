## About

The DEA Tasseled Cap Percentiles product provides an annual summary of environmental conditions across the Australian landscape using Tasseled Cap indices, a method that transforms raw reflectance data into three components:

 - Brightness: Indicates the overall reflectivity of the land surface, often highlighting bare soil, urban areas or dry conditions.
 - Greenness: Reflects the presence and vigor of photosynthetic vegetation.
 - Wetness: Captures moisture content in soil and vegetation, helping to identify waterlogged or saturated areas.

To capture how these conditions vary throughout the year, the product includes percentile values for each tasseled cap index:

- The 10th percentile represents conditions that are lower than 90% of observations—typically the driest, least green, or least reflective states recorded during the year.
- The 50th percentile (or median) represents the middle value—a typical or average condition, where half the observations are higher and half are lower.
- The 90th percentile represents conditions that are higher than 90% of observations—typically the greenest, wettest, or brightest states observed.


These percentile summaries are useful for identifying and monitoring environmental features such as wetlands, groundwater-dependent ecosystems, salt lakes, clay pans, and coastal landforms. They are designed to support environmental classification, change detection, and long-term landscape monitoring.
