## About

The DEA Tasseled Cap Percentiles product provides an annual summary of environmental conditions across the Australian landscape using Tasseled Cap indices, a method that transforms raw reflectance data into three components:

 - Brightness: Indicates the overall reflectivity of the land surface, often highlighting bare soil, urban areas or dry conditions.
 - Greenness: Reflects the presence and vigor of photosynthetic vegetation.
 - Wetness: Captures moisture content in soil and vegetation, helping to identify waterlogged or saturated areas.

These percentile summaries are useful for identifying and monitoring environmental features such as wetlands, groundwater-dependent ecosystems, salt lakes, clay pans, and coastal landforms. They are designed to support environmental classification, change detection, and long-term landscape monitoring.
