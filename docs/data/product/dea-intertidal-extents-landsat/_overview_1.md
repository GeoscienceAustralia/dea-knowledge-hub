## About

Understanding the boundaries of the ‘intertidal zone’ — the strip of coastal land revealed and concealed daily by ocean tides — has long been a challenge. Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Intertidal Extents gives definition to complex and ephemeral landscapes.

The dataset provides information on the lowest (LOT) and highest (HOT) observed tides for a chosen geographic cell, revealing the satellite-observed tidal range (HOT-LOT) for any given location.
