## Background

Understanding the amount of surface water in the landscape is important for many applications including water management, wetlands, water connectivity, surface-groundwater relationships and flood mapping. This can lead to more effective emergency management and risk assessment.

This product is the implementation of the DEA Water Observations (DEA WO) product (previously known as Water Observations from Space, or WOfS) on the Geoscience Australia Sentinel-2 Near Real Time surface reflectance product.

The Provisional Digital Earth Australia Water Observations (Sentinel-2) product shows where surface water was observed by the Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites on any particular day over the most recent 3 months. The surface water observations are derived from Geoscience Australia Sentinel-2 Near Real Time surface reflectance imagery for all of Australia. The provisional, Near Real Time product is available for a rolling window of the most recent three months of data, and is produced within 24 hours of the satellite passing over an area.

## What this product offers

The Provisional Digital Earth Australia Water Observations product shows the extent of surface water in a corresponding Sentinel-2 scene, along with the degree to which the scene was obscured by data quality issues including; cloud, cloud shadows, and where sensor problems cause parts of a scene to not be observable. The Water observations are based on the WOfS algorithm which underpins all of the Digital Earth Australia surface reflectance water products. 

This is a rapid, provisional, product. It has not been validated and is of unknown accuracy, however it may provide useful information about the general extents of surface water soon after an image is acquired.

% ## Data description

## Applications

The Digital Earth Australia Near Real Time Water Observation product is provided as a provisional (not validated, with unknown accuracy) source of information on water in the landscape to help inform emergency management and decision makers on recent and evolving emergency situations. The product can be used to estimate the area of surface water present in the corresponding satellite scene, and can be used for several water monitoring applications. Uses of the individual Water Observations (WOs) includes:
* flood extent
* amount of water in water bodies, major rivers and the coastal zone.

As the WOs are separated from the derived statistics of the associated DEA Water statistical products, the WOs are most useful for performing analyses requiring the investigation of surface water extent for particular times rather than over long term time series.

## Technical information

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Water Observations (Sentinel-2) Provisional is a dataset indicating areas where surface water has been observed using the Geoscience Australia Sentinel-2 surface reflectance imagery catalogue. The Near Real Time version of this product includes observations from the most recent three months of data collected by the Sentinel-2 satellites. Near Real Time products are created with predicted corrections for atmospheric conditions and ground reflectivity. It covers all of mainland Australia and Tasmania but excludes off-shore Territories. The dataset is updated automatically as each new Sentinel-2 scene is acquired and processed to Near Real Time Analysis Ready Data (ARD) state. 

The Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Water detection algorithm is used to generate a pixel wise classification of Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B scenes. The output of this algorithm is a classification with the bit meanings described in Table 1. Because of the way the current version (Version 3.1.6) of the WOfS algorithm operates multiple bits can be set simultaneously for each pixel. Hence the value of a pixel in an observation can be X AND Y AND Z, etc, hence values can range from 0 to 255.

**Table 1:** The table below describes the meaning of each bit set per pixel. Where multiple factors impeding a clear observation are detected all the respective bits will be set. For example a value of 136 indicates water (128) AND terrain shadow (8) were observed for the pixel.

| 6   | cloud           | 64            | Pixel masked out due to cloud                                            |
| 7   | water           | 128           | Water detected                                                           |

## Lineage

The DEA Water Observations dataset is generated using the following steps:

Imagery of the earth’s surface is collected by the Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites as a raster based product. Digital Earth Australia receive this data and conduct atmospheric and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function corrections to produce Geoscience Australia Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data to predicted (NRT) standard.

Once the input data has been processed to ARD the Water Observations from Space (WOfS) algorithm is applied, including cloud and shadow masking, on a per-granule basis and indexed into the Data Cube for further processing.

## Processing steps

### 1. Surface Reflectance Calculation (NBAR + Terrain Illumination Correction)
Calculate a standardised optical surface reflectance using robust physical models to correct for variations in image radiance values due to atmospheric properties, sun and sensor geometry and accounts for the directional reflectance properties of the surface.  The process also accounts for the underlying surface topography via a process known as terrain illumination correction.

The process of producing standardised optical surface reflectance is known as Nadir corrected Bi-directional reflectance distribution function Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) coupled with a Terrain illumination correction.

This enables comparison of imagery acquired at different times, in different seasons, in different geographic locations over varying surface topography.

### 2. Water Observations from Space Detection Algorithm
The water detection algorithm used to detect water from each observed pixel is based on a statistical regression tree analysis of a set of normalised difference indices and corrected band values. The regression is based on a set of water and non-water samples created by visual interpretation of 20 Landsat scenes from across Australia. The sample locations, indicated below, ensure that the logistic regression is based on the full geographic range of conditions experienced in Australia.

The regression analysis determined a set of best indices and bands for the analysis and the associated thresholds in each component to derive a final classification tree, producing a water/non-water classification for pixel in the Data Cube. The final water classification for each pixel is modified by Pixel Quality (see associated PQ product information) and terrain.
Once the water algorithm has completed its process, the water detection for a pixel through time is combined to produce a total number of water observations for each pixel. This is compared to a total number of clear observations for the same pixel, derived from the PQ analysis. The ratio is expressed as a percentage water recurrence.

Confidence that a pixel depicted as having had water detected at some time is calculated by a Confidence Layer. The layer is computed by combining a set of confidence factors using a weighted sum approach, with the weightings derived by logistic regression.
