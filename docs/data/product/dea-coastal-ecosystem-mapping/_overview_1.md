## About

The Digital Earth Australia Coastal Ecosystem Mapping dataset delivers a holistic mapping of Australian coastal extents for mangrove, saltmarsh, saltflat, tidal flat and intertidal seagrass ecosystems. The probabilistic extents of these ecosystems are separately modelled and combined to create national, classified ecosystem extents for the years 2021 and 2022 at 10 metre spatial resolution.
