## Changelog

## DEA Coastal Ecosystems 1.0.0

In April 2024, [version 1.0.0 was released](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-intertidal/releases/tag/1.0.0) of the DEA Intertidal product suite. The elevation data layer of this product supersedes the [National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model](/data/version-history/dea-intertidal-elevation-landsat-1.0.0/) product. (The Intertidal Elevation product has hence been deprecated.)
