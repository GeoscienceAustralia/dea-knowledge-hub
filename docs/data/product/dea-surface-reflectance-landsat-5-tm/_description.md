## Background

The United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Landsat satellite program has been capturing images of the Australian continent for more than 30 years. This data is highly useful for land and coastal mapping studies.

In particular, the light reflected from the Earth’s surface (surface reflectance) is important for monitoring environmental resources – such as agricultural production and mining activities – over time.

We need to make accurate comparisons of imagery acquired at different times, seasons and geographic locations. However, inconsistencies can arise due to variations in atmospheric conditions, sun position, sensor view angle, surface slope and surface aspect. These need to be reduced or removed to ensure the data is consistent and can be compared over time.

## What this product offers

This product takes Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery captured over the Australian continent and corrects for inconsistencies across land and coastal fringes. The result is accurate and standardised surface reflectance data, which is instrumental in identifying and quantifying environmental change.

This product is a single, cohesive Analysis Ready Data (ARD) package, which allows you to analyse surface reflectance data as is, without the need to apply additional corrections.

It contains three sub-products that provide corrections or attribution information:

* [DEA Surface Reflectance NBAR (Landsat 5 TM)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-nbar-landsat-5-tm)
* [DEA Surface Reflectance NBART (Landsat 5 TM)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-nbart-landsat-5-tm)
* [DEA Surface Reflectance OA (Landsat 5 TM)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-oa-landsat-5-tm)

The resolution is a 30 m grid based on the USGS Landsat Collection 1 archive.

% ## Data description

## Applications

* The development of derivative products to monitor land, inland waterways and coastal features, such as:
  * urban growth  
  * coastal habitats  
  * mining activities  
  * agricultural activity (e.g. pastoral, irrigated cropping, rain-fed cropping)  
  * water extent
* The development of refined information products, such as:
  * area/units of detected surface water  
  * area/units of deforestation  
  * yield predictions of agricultural parcels
* Compliance surveys
* Emergency management

## Technical information

### The Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor

The TM is an advanced, multispectral scanning, Earth resources sensor which is designed to categorise the Earth's surface. It is particularly useful for agricultural applications and identification of land use. 

### The Analysis Ready Data concept

The Analysis Ready Data (ARD) package allows you to get up and running with your analysis as quickly as possible with minimal data preparation and additional input. This makes it simpler for you to develop applications and for the database to execute queries.

The satellite data has been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organised into a form that allows immediate analysis and interoperability through time and with other datasets. It has been adapted from CEOS Analysis Ready Data ([CARD4L](http://ceos.org/ard/)).

The [technical report](https://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/145101) containing the data summary for the Phase 1 DEA Surface Reflectance Validation is available.

### ARD sub-products

1. [DEA Surface Reflectance NBAR (Landsat 5 TM)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-nbar-landsat-5-tm)
This sub-product produces standardised optical surface reflectance data using robust physical models which correct for variations and inconsistencies in image radiance values. Corrections are performed using Nadir corrected Bi-directional reflectance distribution function Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR).
2. [DEA Surface Reflectance NBART (Landsat 5 TM)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-nbart-landsat-5-tm)
This sub-product performs the same function as Surface Reflectance (Landsat 5 TM NBAR), but also applies terrain illumination correction.
3. [DEA Surface Reflectance OA (Landsat 5 TM)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-oa-landsat-5-tm)

The NBAR and NBART sibling products depend upon the OA product to provide accurate and reliable contextual information about the Landsat data. This ‘data provenance’ provides a chain of information which allows the data to be replicated or utilised by derivative applications. It takes a number of different forms, including satellite, solar and surface geometry and classification attribution labels.
