## Accuracy

The accuracy of the stacked line plots is dependent on the accuracy of the underlying algorithms: Water Observations from Space (Mueller et al. 2016) and the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program's Fractional Cover algorithm (Scarth et al. 2010). 

The Tasseled Cap Wetness threshold used in the Wetlands Insight Tool has been compared with independent inundation data for one major wetland complex, however the Tasseled Cap Wetness index may under or overestimate the actual extent of inundation for individual wetlands.  The use of a consistent threshold means that the 'precision' is high, insofar as you're measuring the same aspect of the wetland at each point in time, however the accuracy with which Tasseled Cap Wetness measures free water underneath/within wetland vegetation is not quantified.

The interpretability of the results for each polygon is dependent on the accuracy of the linework that has been used to create that polygon.  

The 30 metre resolution of Landsat imposes an intrinsic limitation on the Wetlands Insight Tool.  Wetland areas that are small, or long and narrow in nature are likely to be inaccurate (due to inclusion of neighbouring non-wetland pixels) or difficult to interpret (stack line plots for areas with a small number of pixels have sharp steps in them).

The period of time between when Landsat 5 ceased operations (November 2011) and Landsat 8 data became routinely available (May 2013) is likely to be inaccurate.  There will be some wetlands, close the centre of Landsat paths where Landsat 7 continued to capture suitable (gap free) data, however it is safer, as a general rule, to consider this period as 'low data quality'.

## Quality assurance

Quality assurance was undertaken to ensure that a Wetlands Insight Tool stacked line plot was generated for every polygon in the QLD WetlandInfo polygon set.
