layers_table:
  - name: shorelines_annual
    description: Annual shoreline vectors that represent the median or ‘most representative’ position of the shoreline at approximately 0 m Above Mean Sea Level for each year since 1988.
    attributes:
      - name: year
        type: Integer
        units: Date
        description: The year of each annual shoreline.
      - name: certainty
        type: String
        units: null
        description: A column providing important data quality flags for each annual shoreline.  For more information, see the `Quality tab <./?tab=quality>`_.
      - name: tide_datum
        type: String
        units: null
        description: The tide datum of each annual shoreline (e.g. “0 m AMSL”).
      - name: id_primary
        type: String
        units: null
        description: The name of the annual shoreline’s Primary sediment compartment from the `Australian Coastal Sediment Compartments <https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/21a23d9a-00dd-ab19-e053-10a3070a2746>`_ framework.

  - name: rates_of_change
    description: A point dataset providing robust rates of coastal change for every 30 m along Australia’s non-rocky coastlines.
    attributes:
      - name: uid
        type: String
        units: null
        description: A unique geohash identifier for each point.
      - name: rate_time
        type: Float
        units: Metres per year
        description: Annual rates of change (in metres per year) calculated by linearly regressing annual shoreline distances against time (excluding outliers). Negative values indicate retreat and positive values indicate growth.
      - name: sig_time
        type: Float
        units: P-value
        description: Significance (p-value) of the linear relationship between annual shoreline distances and time. Small values (e.g. p-value < 0.01 or 0.05) may indicate a coastline is undergoing consistent coastal change through time.
      - name: se_time
        type: Float
        units: Metres
        description: Standard error (in metres) of the linear relationship between annual shoreline distances and time. This can be used to generate confidence intervals around the rate of change given by ``rate_time``, e.g. :math:`\text{95% confidence interval} = \text{se_time} \times 1.96`
      - name: outl_time
        type: String
        units: null
        description: Individual annual shoreline are noisy estimators of coastline position that can be influenced by environmental conditions (e.g. clouds, breaking waves, sea spray) or modelling issues (e.g. poor tidal modelling results or limited clear satellite observations). To obtain reliable rates of change, outlier shorelines are excluded using a robust Median Absolute Deviation outlier detection algorithm, and recorded in this column.
      - name: dist_1990, dist_1991, etc
        type: Float
        units: Metres
        description: Annual shoreline distances (in metres) relative to the most recent baseline shoreline. Negative values indicate that an annual shoreline was located inland of the baseline shoreline. By definition, the most recent baseline column will always have a distance of 0 m.
      - name: angle_mean, angle_std
        type: Integer
        units: Degrees
        description: The mean angle and standard deviation between the baseline point to all annual shorelines. This data is used to calculate how well shorelines fall along a consistent line; high angular standard deviation indicates that derived rates of change are unlikely to be correct.
      - name: valid_obs
        type: Integer
        units: Count
        description: The total number of valid (i.e. non-outliers, non-missing) annual shoreline observations.
      - name: valid_span
        type: Integer
        units: Years
        description: The maximum number of years between the first and last valid annual shoreline.
      - name: sce
        type: Float
        units: Metres
        description: Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE). A measure of the maximum change or variability across all annual shorelines, calculated by computing the maximum distance between any two annual shorelines (excluding outliers). This statistic excludes sub-annual shoreline variability.
      - name: nsm
        type: Float
        units: Metres
        description: Net Shoreline Movement (NSM). The distance between the oldest (1988) and most recent annual shoreline (excluding outliers). Negative values indicate the coastline retreated between the oldest and most recent shoreline; positive values indicate growth. This statistic does not reflect sub-annual shoreline variability, so will underestimate the full extent of variability at any given location.
      - name: max_year
        type: Integer
        units: Date
        description: The year that annual shorelines were at their maximum (i.e. located furthest towards the ocean), excluding outliers. This statistic excludes sub-annual shoreline variability.
      - name: min_year
        type: Integer
        units: Date
        description: The year that annual shorelines were at their minimum (i.e. located furthest inland), excluding outliers. This statistic excludes sub-annual shoreline variability.
      - name: certainty
        type: String
        units: null
        description: A column providing important data quality flags for each point in the dataset. For more information, see the `Quality tab <./?tab=quality>`_.
      - name: id_primary
        type: String
        units: null
        description: The name of the point’s Primary sediment compartment from the `Australian Coastal Sediment Compartments <https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/21a23d9a-00dd-ab19-e053-10a3070a2746>`_ framework.

  - name: hotspots_zoom_1, hotspots_zoom_2, hotspots_zoom_3
    description: Three points layers summarising coastal change within moving 1 km, 5 km and 10 km windows along the coastline, containing several additional attributes.
    attributes:
      - name: radius_m
        type: Integer
        units: Metres
        description: The radius of the moving window used to summarise coastal change around this point.
      - name: n
        type: Integer
        units: Count
        description: The number of 'rates_of_change' points that were used in the moving window calculation.
