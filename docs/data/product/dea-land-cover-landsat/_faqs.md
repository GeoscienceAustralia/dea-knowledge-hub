## Frequently Asked Questions

:::{dropdown} I was using Land Cover Collection 2 in my workflow. What are the key differences in Collection 3 that I should be aware of?
While Version 1 (Collection 2) was at 25 m spatial resolution, Version 2 (Collection 3) is at 30 m resolution.

The overall performance of Version 2 is in line with that of Version 1. 

However, the classification of Artificial Surface is notably better in Version 2, meaning the number of pixels in that class will be considerably higher. The Woody Cover ratio also seems to have improved in Version 2.

Some inconsistencies were observed in the areas assigned to the Cultivated Vegetation class, although the overall accuracy for this class remains similar between the two collections. Moreover, a significant degradation in Version 2 is the increase in Landsat 7 stripe artefacts.
