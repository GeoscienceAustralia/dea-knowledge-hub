## Frequently Asked Questions

:::{dropdown} I was using Land Cover Collection 2 in my workflow. What are the key differences in Collection 3 that I should be aware of?
The overall performance of Collection 3 (C3) is in line with that of Collection 2 (C2). 

However, the classification of Artificial Surface is notably better in C3, meaning the number of pixels in that class will be considerably higher. The Woody Cover ratio also seems to have improved in C3.

Some inconsistencies were observed in the areas assigned to the Cultivated Vegetation class, although the overall accuracy for this class remains similar between the two collections. Moreover, a significant degradation in C3 is the increase in Landsat 7 stripe artefacts.
