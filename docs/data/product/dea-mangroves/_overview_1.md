## About

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Mangroves classifies mangrove canopy cover density across Australia’s coastal ecosystems using 35+ years of Landsat data (1987–present) at 30-meter resolution. This dataset provides critical environmental intelligence for climate change monitoring, coastal protection planning, biodiversity conservation, and disaster response. By tracking mangrove health and extent over time, it enables assessment of how cyclones, sea level rise, and extreme weather events impact these critical carbon storage ecosystems, supporting evidence-based coastal management and conservation decisions. The ongoing maintenance and annual updates of this long-term monitoring resource advances scientific research and supports sustainable coastal management for public benefit.
