## Background

The European Space Agency (ESA) has operated medium resolution satellites - Sentinel-2 series (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) since 2015. The spectral bands and spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 are similar to those of the Landsat series, but Sentinel-2 has a higher revisit frequency and spatial coverage. A combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat data can provide good spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth's surface and provide useful information to monitor environmental resources over time, such as agricultural production and mining activities. However, the raw remotely sensed data received by these satellites in the solar spectral range do not directly characterise the underlying reflectance of surface objects. The data are modified by the atmosphere, variation of solar and sensor positions as well as surface anisotropic conditions. To make accurate comparisons of imagery acquired at different times, seasons and geographic locations, and detect the change of surface, it is necessary to remove/reduce these effects to ensure the data are consistent and can be compared over time.

## What this product offers

This product takes Sentinel-2A imagery captured over the Australian continent and corrects for inconsistencies across land and coastal fringes. The result is accurate and standardised surface reflectance data, which is instrumental in identifying and quantifying environmental change.

The imagery is captured using the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensor aboard Sentinel-2A.

This product is a single, cohesive Analysis Ready Data (ARD) package, which allows the analysis of surface reflectance data as is, without the need to apply additional corrections.

It contains two sub-products that provide corrections or attribution information:
* [DEA Surface Reflectance NBART (Sentinel-2A MSI)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-nbart-sentinel-2a-msi)
* [DEA Surface Reflectance OA (Sentinel-2A MSI)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-oa-sentinel-2a-msi)

The resolution is a 10/20/60 m grid based on the ESA Level 1C archive.
*Note: DEA produces NBAR as part of the Landsat ARD. This product is **not produced as part of the Sentinel-2 ARD**.*

**This Collection 3 (C3) product** and has been created by reprocessing Collection 1 (C1) and making improvements to the processing pipeline and packaging.
See the [History tab](./?tab=history) for more details.

**The introduction of a maturity concept.**

The Collection 3 product is comprised of data produced to varying degrees of maturity. The maturity of a dataset is dictated by the quality of the ancillary information, such as BRDF and atmospheric data, used to generate the product. The maturity levels are Near Real Time (NRT), Interim and Final. The maturity level is designated in the filename and in the metadata.

* Near Real Time (NRT) is a rapid ARD product produced < 48 hours after image capture.   
* Interim ARD – If there are extended delays (>18 days) in delivery of inputs to the ARD model, interim production is utilised until the issue is resolved.    
* Final ARD - As the higher quality ancillary datasets become available, a “Final” version of the Sentinel 2 ARD data is produced, which replaces the NRT or interim product.

## Technical information

### Multispectral Instrument (MSI)

MSI is a push-broom sensor with A Three-Mirror Anastigmat (TMA) telescope with a pupil diameter equivalent to 150 mm, isostatically mounted on the platform to minimise thermo-elastic distortions. Surface Reflectance values range between 0 and 10000. MSI collects data for visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared spectral bands. 

### The Analysis Ready Data concept

The Analysis Ready Data (ARD) package allows you to get up and running with your analysis as quickly as possible with minimal data preparation and additional input. This makes it simpler for you to develop applications and for the database to execute queries.

The satellite data has been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organised into a form that allows immediate analysis and interoperability through time and with other datasets. It has been adapted from CEOS Analysis Ready Data ([CARD4L](http://ceos.org/ard/)).

The [technical report](https://pid.geoscience.gov.au/dataset/ga/145101) containing the data summary for the Phase 1 DEA Surface Reflectance Validation is available.

### ARD sub-products

1) [DEA Surface Reflectance NBART (Sentinel-2A MSI)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-nbart-sentinel-2a-msi)

The sub-product produces standardised optical surface reflectance data using robust physical models which correct for variations and inconsistencies in the image of top atmospheric reflectance values. Corrections are performed using Nadir corrected Bidirectional reflectance distribution function Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) with an additional terrain illumination correction applied (NBART).

2) [DEA Surface Reflectance OA (Sentinel-2A MSI)](/data/product/dea-surface-reflectance-oa-sentinel-2a-msi)

The NBART product depends upon the Observation Attributes (OA) product to provide accurate and reliable contextual information about the Sentinel-2B data. This ‘data provenance’ provides a chain of information which allows the data to be replicated or utilised by derivative applications. The OA takes a number of different forms, including satellite, solar and surface geometry and classification attribution labels.

## Lineage
