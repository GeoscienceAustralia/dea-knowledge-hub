## Accuracy

The accuracy of the GeoMAD layers is dependent on the accuracy of the earth observation data on which it is based. 

To calculate a reliable geometric median or MAD, the majority of the input data must be free of clouds, shadows, or other visual obstructions. For locations that experience more than 50% of time under clouds and shadows (such as areas of Tasmania) the GeoMAD can produce an output that is obscured by visual noise. Therefore, it is necessary to use a large enough collection of data to prevent this occurring. 

To reduce the impact of poor-quality earth observation data, the input data is screened using the Pixel Quality product.  

Note that where no-data pixels occur in locations that clear observations should occur, the cause is a lack of clear pixels to populate the GeoMAD. 

Also, note that since  the geometric median and MAD are synthetic (not observed directly by satellite), they cannot be verified by field work.
