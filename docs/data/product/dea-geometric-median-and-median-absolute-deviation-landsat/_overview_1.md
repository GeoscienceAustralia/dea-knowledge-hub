## About

The DEA Geometric Median and Median Absolute Deviation products use statistical analyses to provide information on variance in the landscape over the given year. They provide insight into the "average" conditions observed over Australia in a given year, as well as the amount of variability experienced around that average. These products are useful for monitoring change detection, such as from cropping, urban expansion or burnt area mapping.
