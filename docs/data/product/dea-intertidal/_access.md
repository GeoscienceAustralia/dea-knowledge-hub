:::{dropdown} How to access the data

To download DEA Intertidal data:
1. Click the [Link to data](https://data.dea.ga.gov.au/?prefix=derivative/ga_s2ls_intertidal_cyear_3/) link above
2. Click on the [ga_summary_grid_c3_32km_coastal.geojson](https://data.dea.ga.gov.au/?prefix=derivative/ga_s2ls_intertidal_cyear_3/ga_summary_grid_c3_32km_coastal.geojson) file to download to your computer. This file can be used in a GIS package to identify the product tiles that you require for a given location. Alternatively, you can access this file via DEA Maps to identify required tiles (`Sea, ocean and coast > DEA Intertidal > DEA Intertidal 32 km tile grid`). 
3. Navigate to the required tile folder, first using the tile x reference (e.g. `x079`) and then the tile y reference (e.g. `y123`). Then select your year of interest.
4. Click on the required product layer to download. See [Technical Information](./?tab=details#technical-information) for details on file naming and product layer details.â€¯

:::{dropdown} How to explore DEA Maps
To explore DEA Intertidal on the interactive DEA Maps platform, visit the link below:
[https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/story/DEAIntertidal](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/story/DEAIntertidal)

To add DEA Coastlines to DEA Maps manually:
1. Open [DEA Maps](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/).
2. Select `Explore map data` on the top-left.
3. Select `Sea, ocean and coast > DEA Intertidal > DEA Intertidal`
4. Click the  `Add to the map` button on top-right.

View the product layer required by selecting the layer from the `Styles` dropdown menu, and use the `Time` selector to view the annual time-series of each product layer.

Note that the colour ramp for the `Elevation` and `Elevation Uncertainty` product layers is scaled dynamically from `low` to `high` to account from the wide variation of tidal ranges and elevations found across Australia, and provide the best contrast on the DEA Maps platform. 

To query an absolute value for any of the product layers, click on a location to see a plain text summary of all the DEA Intertidal product suite data values at that pixel location.
