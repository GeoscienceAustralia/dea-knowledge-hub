:::{dropdown} How to access the data

To download DEA Intertidal data:
1. Click the [Link to data](https://data.dea.ga.gov.au/?prefix=derivative/ga_s2ls_intertidal_cyear_3/) link above
2. Click on the GRID file to download to your computer. This file can be used in a GIS package to identify the product tiles that you require for a given location. Alternatively, you can access this file via DEA maps (LINK) to identify required tiles. 
3. Navigate to the required tile folder, first using the tile x reference (e.g. `x079`) and then the tile y reference (e.g. `y123`). Then select your year of interest.
4. Click on the required product layer to download. See [Technical Information](./?tab=details#technical-information) for details on file naming and product layer details.â€¯

:::{dropdown} How to explore DEA Maps
To explore DEA Intertidal on the interactive DEA Maps platform, visit the link below:
[https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/story/DEAIntertidal](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/#share=s-DEAIntertidal&playStory=1)

To add DEA Coastlines to DEA Maps manually:
1. Open [DEA Maps](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/).
2. Select `Explore map data` on the top-left.
3. Select `Sea, ocean and coast > DEA Coastlines > DEA Coastlines`
4. Click the blue `Add to the map` button on top-right.

By default, the map will show hotspots of coastal change at continental scale. Red dots represent retreating coastlines (e.g. erosion), while blue dots indicate seaward growth. The larger the dots and the brighter the colour, the more coastal change that is occurring at the location. 

More detailed rates of change points will be displayed as you zoom in. To view a time series chart of how a coastal region or area of coastline has changed over time, click on any point (press "Expand" on the pop-up for more detail):

Zoom in further to view individual annual shorelines:

**Note:** To view a DEA Coastlines layer that is not currently visible (e.g. rates of change points at full zoom), each layer can be added to the map individually from the `Sea, ocean and coast > DEA Coastlines > Supplementary data` directory.
