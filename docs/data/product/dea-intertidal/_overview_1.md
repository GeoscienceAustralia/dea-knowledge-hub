## About

The DEA Intertidal product suite maps the changing elevation, exposure and tidal characteristics of Australia’s exposed intertidal zone, the complex zone that defines the interface between land and sea.
 
Incorporating both Sentinel-2 and Landsat data, the product suite provides an annual 10 m resolution elevation product for the intertidal zone, enabling users to better monitor and understand some of the most dynamic regions of Australia’s coastlines. Utilising an improved tidal modelling capability, the product suite includes a continental scale mapping of intertidal exposure over time, enabling scientists and managers to integrate the data into ecological and migratory species applications and modelling.  

:::{admonition} Streaming data from AWS is strongly recommended
:class: note

DEA Intertidal data is extremely large with files up to 15 GB in size. We strongly recommend streaming data directly from the cloud rather than downloading the data. Please see the instructions on the Access tab: [How to stream data from AWS](./?tab=access#access-guides)
