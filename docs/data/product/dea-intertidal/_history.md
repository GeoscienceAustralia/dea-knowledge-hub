## Changelog

## DEA Intertidal 2.0.0

In May 2024, DEA Intertidal was [updated to version 2.0.0](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-intertidal/releases/tag/2.0.0) and 2024 data was added to all layers in the product suite. This update also includes the following.

* The [DEA Intertidal Extents](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#core-product-layers) layer was added, which in combination with the DEA Intertidal Elevation and Exposure data layers supersedes the [DEA Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM)](/data/version-history/dea-intertidal-extents-landsat-2.0.0/) product. (The ITEM product has hence been deprecated.)
* [Ensemble tide modelling](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#ensemble-tidal-modelling) is now delivered via the [eo-tides](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/eo-tides) Python package.
* Quality assessment layers were added: [qa_count_clear](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#quality-assessment-layers) and [qa_coastal_mask](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#quality-assessment-layers). 

## DEA Intertidal 1.0.0
