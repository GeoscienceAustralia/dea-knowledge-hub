## Changelog

## DEA Intertidal 2.0.0

In May 2025, DEA Intertidal was [updated to version 2.0.0](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-intertidal/releases/tag/2.0.0) and 2023 data was added to all layers in the product suite. This update also includes the following changes.

* The [DEA Intertidal Extents](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#core-product-layers) layer was added. This new data layer, in combination with the existing elevation and exposure layers supersedes the [DEA Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM)](/data/version-history/dea-intertidal-extents-landsat-2.0.0/) product. (The ITEM product has hence been deprecated.)
* [Ensemble tide modelling](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#ensemble-tidal-modelling) is now delivered via the [eo-tides](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/eo-tides) tide modelling Python package.
* New quality assessment layers were added: [qa_count_clear](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#quality-assessment-layers) and [qa_coastal_connectivity](/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#quality-assessment-layers). 

## DEA Intertidal 1.0.0

In April 2024, [version 1.0.0 was released](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-intertidal/releases/tag/1.0.0) of the DEA Intertidal product suite. The elevation data layer of this product supersedes the [National Intertidal Digital Elevation Model](/data/version-history/dea-intertidal-elevation-landsat-1.0.0/) product. (The Intertidal Elevation product has hence been deprecated.)
