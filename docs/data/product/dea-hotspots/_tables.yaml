layers_table:
  - name: Hotspot
    description: The attributes and metadata included with each Hotspot vary according to the access mechanism used to interact with the Hotspot information. E.g., the Hotspots portal contains a subset of these attributes, while the Geoscience Australia Historic Hotspot database (the Historic database) contains the full metadata record for each Hotspot.
    attributes:
      - name: ID
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Numeric ID assigned to the Hotspot.
      - name: Satellite
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Name of the satellite platform that is carrying the sensor used to acquire the satellite data for hotspots calculation (e.g., Aqua, Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, NOAA-21).

        units: null
        description: National Space Science Data Centre (NSSDC) unique satellite number. `Learn more <http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/>`_
      - name: Satellite_operating_agency
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Name of the agency providing the satellite data (e.g., NASA).
      - name: Sensor
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Name of the sensor used to detect the Hotspot (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, AHI).
      - name: Orbit
        type: null
        units: null
        description: The orbit number is determined using the information provided in the NORAD Two Line Element (TLE) file(s). The TLE file provides reference information foran “epoch” orbit that allows the current orbit to be calculated using the acquisition information. A value of -1 indicates the orbit is not reported.
      - name: Start_dt
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Start date and time (in UTC) of the satellite pass acquisition.
      - name: Stop_dt
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Stop date and time (in UTC) of the satellite pass acquisition. Note that Himawari-9, NOAA-20, and Suomi NPP do not have Stop_dt information. 
      - name: Filename
        type: null
        units: null
        description: "File name that the Hotspot is contained in and uses the following format: satellite_dateUTC_Hotspot.txt"
      - name: Process_dt
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Date and time (in UTC) that the Hotspot was processed (file creation time).
      - name: Process_algorithm
        type: null
        units: null
        description: The name of the algorithm used to producethe Hotspot (e.g., MOD14, AFIMG, BRIGHT AHI).
      - name: Process_algorithm_version
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Algorithm version number used to produce the Hotspot.
      - name: Product
        type: null
        units: null

        units: null
        description: Date and time (in UTC) that the Hotspot was loaded into the database.
      - name: Latitude
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Hotspot latitude is based on WGS84 (º). (For more information, see the Product Description.)
      - name: Longitude

      - name: Confidence
        type: null
        units: null
        description: The Confidence attribute is intended to help users to gauge the quality of individual fire pixels within the fire mask. GA displays and provides all Hotspots, regardless of confidence. Users can choose to filter on the confidence attribute, according to their use case. (For more information, see the Product Description.)
      - name: Datetime
        type: null
        units: null
