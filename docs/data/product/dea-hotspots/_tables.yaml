layers_table:
  - name: Hotspot
    description: The attributes and metadata included with each Hotspot vary according to the access mechanism used to interact with the Hotspot information. E.g., the Hotspots portal contains a subset of these attributes, while the Geoscience Australia Historic Hotspot database (the Historic database) contains the full metadata record for each Hotspot.
    attributes:
      - name: id
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Numeric ID assigned to the Hotspot.
      - name: satellite
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Name of the satellite platform that is carrying the sensor used to acquire the satellite data for hotspots calculation (e.g., Aqua, Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, NOAA-21).
      - name: satellite_nssdc_id
        type: null
        units: null
        description: National Space Science Data Centre (NSSDC) unique satellite number. [Learn more](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/)
      - name: satellite_operating_agency
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Name of the agency providing the satellite data (e.g., NASA).
      - name: sensor
        type: null
        units: null
        description: Name of the sensor used to detect the Hotspot (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS, AVHRR, AHI).
      - name: orbit
        type: null
        units: null
        description: The orbit number is determined using the information provided in the NORAD Two Line Element (TLE) file(s).The TLE file provides reference information foran “epoch” orbit that allows the current orbit to be calculated using the acquisition information. A value of -1 indicates the orbit is not reported.
