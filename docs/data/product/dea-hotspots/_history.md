## 23 May 2025: NOAA-19-derived DEA Hotspots discontinued from 16 June 2025

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has announced the discontinuation of data collection from the NOAA-19 satellite from 16 June 2025. The satellite's Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is currently used for capturing thermal anomalies and providing a night-time overpass for DEA Hotspots under the Landgate AVHRR layer which will no longer be available from this date. 

No action is required. Users can prepare by transitioning to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Hotspots and Himawari-9 Hotspots which remain available. VIIRS Hotspots from Suomi NPP, NOAA-20, and NOAA-21 are available and provide coverage in the afternoon and night-time, whilst Himawari-9 Hotspots are updated continuously every ten minutes.

### 19 Dec 2024: NOAA-21-derived DEA Hotspots are now available

Following our [communication](https://communication.ga.gov.au/link/id/zzzz675f7ce74a008871Pzzzz6567c8b713b5b826/page.html) in November regarding changes to the Hotspots service, we are pleased to advise that Hotspots derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard NOAA-21 are now available. NOAA-21 currently passes over Australia at approximately 3pm and 2am Australian Eastern Standard Time, increasing the density and reliability of the afternoon and nighttime observations.

In the Hotspots application, the NOAA-21 feed is off by default. You can include either the VIIRS ‘AFIMG NOAA-21’, or ‘AFMOD NOAA-21’ Hotspots algorithms as additional layers in the Hotspots map interface by selecting these layers from the VIIRS menu in the legend.

### 18 Nov 2024: DEA Hotspots &mdash; Enhancing Bushfire Monitoring with New Satellite Data

We are writing to keep you informed of changes that are occurring to the DEA Hotspots service. While faced with the loss of the MODIS Terra for our morning observations, we can continue to use available satellites to bolster the density and reliability of our afternoon observations. Data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard NOAA-21 will be available in DEA Hotspots by early December 2024. Once NOAA-21 data is available, a tech alert will be issued to users.
