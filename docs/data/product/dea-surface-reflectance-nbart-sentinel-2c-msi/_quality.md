## Accuracy

Atmospheric correction accuracy depends on the quality of aerosol data and total column water vapour available to determine the atmospheric profile at the time of image acquisition (Wang et al., 2009).

BRDF correction is based on low resolution imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is assumed to be relevant to medium resolution imagery such as that captured by Sentinel-2A MSI. A single BRDF shape is applied to each Sentinel-2A tile and it does not account for changes in land cover. 

The algorithm assumes that BRDF effect for inclined surfaces is modelled by the surface slope and does not account for land cover orientation relative to gravity (as occurs for some broadleaf vegetation with vertical leaf orientation).

The accuracy of the terrain correction also depend on the quality, scale and spatial resolution of the DSM data used and the co-registration between the DSM and the satellite image (Li et al., 2013). At present, 30 m resolution SRTM DSM data were used for the correction.

The algorithm depends on several auxiliary data sources:
* Availability of relevant MODIS BRDF data
* Availability of relevant aerosol data
* Availability of relevant water vapour data
* Availability of relevant DSM data
* Availability of relevant ozone data

Improved or more accurate sources for any of the above listed auxiliary dependencies will also improve the surface reflectance result.

## Quality assurance

Results from the DEA Cal/Val workflow over 17 data takes from 9 field sites were created based on both BRDF Collections 5 and 6.

The results for each collection were averaged and then compared. The comparison showed small changes in individual field sites, but overall there was no significant difference in the average results over all field sites to within 1% at most.
