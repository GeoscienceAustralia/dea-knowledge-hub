## About

The DEA Coastal Ecosystems product suite maps the extent of coastal ecosystems within Australia’s coastal zone, with a focus on those situated landward of the low-tide boundary.

Developed using Sentinel-2 data, the product suite provides an annual 10 m resolution extent classification layer for four ecosystem classes, enabling users to better monitor and understand the distribution of these ecosystems at a continental scale. The classification layer is supported by ecosystem probability layers for each class, to allow a more nuanced interpretation of the modelled ecosystem extents and to provide users flexibilty for tailored mapping approaches.
