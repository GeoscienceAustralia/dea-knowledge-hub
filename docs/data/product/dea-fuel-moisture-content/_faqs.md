## Frequently asked questions

:::{dropdown} Why does the colour bar only go up to 150% whereas the FMC values go to 300%?

In DEA Maps, the DEA FMC product is visualised using a colour scale that only represents values in the range of 0% to 150%. All values above 150% are displayed in a constant dark blue colour. This provides a more focussed view of the 0-150% range which is the range that is of most interest to understanding flammability.

:::{dropdown} Where is the data for the latest Sentinel-2 satellite overpass?

DEA FMC uses Sentinel-2A, B, and C Analysis Ready Data (ARD) products at the ‘Final’ maturity level. Unlike the ‘Near Real Time (NRT)’ ARD dataset, the ‘Final’ ARD is generated using higher-quality ancillary datasets, which require more time to become available. high and correctionAs a result, there is a delay between the time of satellite acquisition and the time that the finalised ARD imagery used in FMC processing becomes available. For more information, see the [DEA Dataset Maturity guide](https://knowledge.dea.ga.gov.au/guides/reference/dataset_maturity_guide/).
