## About

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) provides a measure of vegetation moisture by calculating the percentage of water mass relative to dry mass in living vegetation. Available for every Sentinel-2 satellite overpass since 2015, it enables valuable insights into vegetation moisture and flammability across the Australian landscape.
