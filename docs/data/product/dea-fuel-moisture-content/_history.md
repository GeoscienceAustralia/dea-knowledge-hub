### Version 1.0.0
The first version of DEA Fuel Moisture Content was released in September 2025. It replaces the MODIS-based Australian Flammability Monitoring System (AFMS), improving the spatial resolution from 500 m to 20 m. This product is based on the work of Dr. Marta Yebra and the team at the Bushfire Research Centre of Excellence at the Australian National University (ANU) with support from Natural Hazards Research Australia.
