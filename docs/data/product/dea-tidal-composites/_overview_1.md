## About

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Tidal Composites are cloud-free imagery mosaics of Australiaâ€™s coasts, estuaries and reefs at low and high tide respectively.
Calculated using a geometric median of Sentinel-2 imagery from the highest and lowest 15 % of observed tides, DEA Tidal Composites deliver an annually updated snapshot of high and low tide Australian coastal environments.

:::{admonition} Streaming data from AWS is strongly recommended
:class: note

DEA Tidal Composite data is extremely large with files up to 15 GB in size. We strongly recommend streaming rather than downloading the data. Please see the instructions on the Access tab: [How to stream data from AWS](./?tab=access#access-guides)
