## About

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Tidal Composites are cloud-free imagery mosaics of Australiaâ€™s coasts, estuaries and reefs at low and high tide respectively.
Calculated using a geometric median of Sentinel-2 imagery from the highest and lowest 15 % of observed tides, DEA Tidal Composites deliver an annually updated snapshot of high and low tide Australian coastal environments.
