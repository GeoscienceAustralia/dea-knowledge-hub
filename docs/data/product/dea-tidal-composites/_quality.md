## Accuracy

### Disclosure

This product can be rendered in both true colour and false colour. Validation and interpretation of surface features has not been attempted here. Interpretation of surface features is at the users own discretion.

### Tide modelling

The Ensemble Tidal Modelling approach was implemented to account for the varying [performance and biases](https://knowledge.dea.ga.gov.au/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#ensemble-tidal-modelling) of existing global ocean tide models across the complex tidal regimes and coastal regions of Australia. The ensemble process utilises ancillary data such as local tide guages and satellite altimetry to select and weight tidal models at any given coastal location, based on how well each model correlates with local satellite-observed patterns of tidal inundation, and water levels measured by satellite altimetry. A single ensemble tidal output was generated by combining the top 3 locally optimal models, representing the most accurate modelled tide heights based on the selection of input models against the validation data.

Ensemble tide modelling, using the same input data and models, for the same temporal epochs was used in the generation of the [DEA Intertidal](https://knowledge.dea.ga.gov.au/data/product/dea-intertidal/) product suite and can consequently be considered for DEA Tidal Composites. The [DEA Intertidal Elevation Uncertainty](https://knowledge.dea.ga.gov.au/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#core-product-layers) dataset is useful to understand both a) highly dynamic coastal environments where tide modelling is less certain and b) geographic influences on tide modelling uncertainty. The latter exist in places where underlying inputs, such as local bathymetry, to tide modelling results in lower certainty in the global tide model. An outcome of this type of uncertainty is that the absolute modelled tide height values may be incorrect. For DEA Tidal Composites, this may result in a slight offset in absolute tide heights at some locations but is unlikely to alter the images that are selected in the upper and lower 15th percentile ranges of tide heights as the overall trends in tidal changes are still maintained by the tide modelling.

### Geomedian calculation

Accuracies and limitations related to geomedian compositing of observations are discussed in Roberts et al (2017).

## Caveats and limitations

* Users should beware of seasonal and diurnal effects in the imagery, especially in the north east of Australia where the footprint of the highest and lowest astronomical tides are large. Consequently, where image acquisition misses the highest astronomical tide, for example, pooling effects of water are still visible in the landscape in lowest observed tidal composite imagery.
* Sun-synchronous Sentinel-2 data acquisition results in low sun angles across southern parts of the Australian coastline, including western Tasmania, Victoria and south Western Australia. Consequently, composite datasets from the south are darker compared to the north. 
* Natural biases exist in the imaging of coastal tide ranges by orbiting spectral satellites such as Sentinel-2. Attempts to quantify these offsets are reported in the supporting [DEA Intertidal Tide Attribute](https://knowledge.dea.ga.gov.au/data/product/dea-intertidal/?tab=description#tidal-attribute-layers) layers. These biases mean that while DEA Tidal Composites represent the upper and lower 15 percent of all satellite observations of the local tide range, they do not represent the upper and lower 15 percent of the full astronomical tide range. DEA Tidal Composites may thus miss some geographic features at the extreme ends of the local tide range at some locations.
* DEA Tidal Composites is delivered as an annually updated dataset, generated from rolling 3-year epochs of input data. In some locations, particularly those affected by regular cloud cover, the number of clear images from the upper and lower parts of the observed tide range may be few, resulting in noisy geomedian data. 
* To maximise data density for clear geomedian outputs, we use a minimum number of 20 input observations. In some locations, 20 observations during the epoch were not available. The [qa_count_clear](./?tab=specifications#bands) layer identifies these locations, which are predominantly terrestrial. The composites of pixels with low clear counts will not be tidally constrained and will be represented identically in both the high and low tide composite datasets.
* All pixels in the `DEA Tidal Composites` data product have been subject to global tide modelling for selection into the high and lowtide geomedian composites. This includes those found inland from the coast. Although absolute tide values are reported for inland pixels in the [`Low threshold` and `High threshold` quality layers](./?tab=description#product-layers), users should beware that tide modelling accuracy decreases with distance from the ocean. Tide heights associated with terrestrial pixels in the geomedian composites are used for modelling purposes only to support the selection of pixels and do not reflect real-world inland tidal conditions.

## Quality assurance

### Data pre-processing

Only quality, clear data was included as input data in DEA Tidal Composites. Data pre-processing included cleansing the imagery of cloudy, cloud-shadow and sunglint.

### Codebase testing

Code used to generate DEA Tidal Composites is run against automated [integration tests](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-intertidal/tree/develop/tests) to ensure that product quality is maintained as updates and improvements are made. These tests verify that the entire product generation workflow is performing as expected, and track changes in product accuracy over time.
