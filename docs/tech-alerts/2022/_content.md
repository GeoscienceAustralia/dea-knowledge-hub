## Jan 2022: Input data changes impacting DEA products

Our satellite data providers are making changes to their systems that may impact you. From January 2022, USGS will no longer be supplying Landsat Collection 1 data, and are encouraging its stakeholders to use USGS Landsat Collection 2 data instead. In line with [USGS' recommendation](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-collection-2), we will transition to using USGS Landsat Collection 2 data.
