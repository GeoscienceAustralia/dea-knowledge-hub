To accommodate an expanded area of coverage of Australia's external territories, the [DEA Summary Product Grid](/guides/reference/collection_3_summary_grid/) is being shifted. The south-west origin point of the grid is being shifted from `-5472000.0, -2688000.0` to `-6912000.0, -4416000.0` (EPSG:3577). Therefore, all tile grid references will shift 18 tiles west and 15 tiles south. For instance, a tile reference of `x10y10` will change to `x28y25`. For a preview, see the [provisional version of the expanded DEA Summary Product Grid](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/#share=s-avXJqwjUtf55qGUmweYY5KYoVnI) on DEA Maps.

All new versions of our 'summary derivative products' will be affected by this change (but existing versions of the products will not be changed).

* It has already been applied to the latest versions of the following products: [DEA Geometric Median and Median Absolute Deviation (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-geometric-median-and-median-absolute-deviation-landsat/), [DEA Water Observations Statistics (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-water-observations-statistics-landsat/), [DEA Fractional Cover Percentiles (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-fractional-cover-percentiles-landsat/), [DEA Tasseled Cap Percentiles (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-tasseled-cap-percentiles-landsat/), and [DEA Mangroves (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-mangroves/), [DEA Land Cover (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-land-cover-landsat/).
