To accommodate an expanded area of coverage of Australia's external territories, the [DEA Summary Product Grid](/guides/reference/collection_3_summary_grid/) is being shifted. The south-west origin point of the grid is being shifted from `-5472000.0, -2688000.0` to `-6912000.0, -4416000.0` (EPSG:3577). Therefore, all tile grid references will shift 18 tiles west and 15 tiles south. For instance, a tile reference of `x10y10` will change to `x28y25`. For a preview, see the [provisional version of the expanded DEA Summary Product Grid](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/#share=s-avXJqwjUtf55qGUmweYY5KYoVnI) on DEA Maps.
