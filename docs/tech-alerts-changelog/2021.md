## 2021-07-16: Collection 3 Landsat data now available

Thanks to the [Geoscience Australia Landsat Collection Upgrade (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNEIG91lu44), 
our data catalogue now includes Collection 3 data for DEA Surface Reflectance, also available through [OWS](https://ows.dea.ga.gov.au/). 
Other Collection 3 products will soon follow, including DEA Water Observations (WOfS), and DEA Fractional Cover.
 
[DEA Notebooks](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/) and the [User Guide](/notebooks/Beginners_guide/README/) 
have been updated with Collection 3 code examples to reflect the upgrade, and our Content Management Interface and 
[DEA Maps platforms](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/) are also being updated.
 
Users of Collection 2 are encouraged to use Collection 3 data.
A staged decommissioning of Collection 2 is underway and will continue into 2022.
Questions can be raised to dea@ga.gov.au.
