## 9 Jan 2020: DEA Notebooks updates

The [DEA Notebooks repository](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/) and the DEA user guide received a 
[major update](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/releases/tag/notebooks_refresh) which includes a 
simplified directory structure and set of improved and easier to use Jupyter notebooks.

These updated notebooks include a new Beginner's Guide aimed at introducing users to DEA and the Open Data Cube. To view these
new notebooks, navigate to the [Beginner's Guide](/notebooks/Beginners_guide/README/) section of the User Guide.
