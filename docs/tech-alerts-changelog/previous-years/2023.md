## 11 Aug 2023: Small systems updates

Technical DEA internals which have changed in the last week.
* Some tweaks to DEA Sandbox DNS resolution last Friday.
* The URL [https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/](https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/) will be changed to show data in the DEA AWS data holdings instead of the NCI holdings.
* Some data gap filling of Landsat 8 ARD, Landsat 8 FC and Landsat 8 WO for 2023.
* Reduced the delay between Sentinel 2 ARD data being produced (on the NCI), and being delivered to AWS. It was *up to 48 hours* and should now be *up to 24 hours*.
