:::{admonition} Upcoming change: Shift in grid origin point
:class: note

In an upcoming change, the south-west origin point of this product grid will be shifted 18 tiles west and 15 tiles south. Therefore, all tile grid references will change. For instance, a tile reference of `x10y10` will change to `x28y25`.

Note that the geographic coordinates of the origin point (`x0y0`) will change. The current coordinates are `-5472000.0, -2688000.0` and the new coordinates will be `-6912000.0, -4416000.0`.

All of our 'summary derivative products' will be affected by this change, including [DEA Geometric Median and Median Absolute Deviation (GeoMAD)](/data/product/dea-geometric-median-and-median-absolute-deviation-landsat/), [DEA Water Observations Statistics (Landsat)](/data/product/dea-water-observations-statistics-landsat/), [DEA Fractional Cover Percentiles](/data/product/dea-fractional-cover-percentiles-landsat/), [DEA Mangroves](/data/product/dea-mangrove-canopy-cover-landsat/), and [DEA Land Cover](/data/product/dea-land-cover-landsat/) (later).

## Introduction

Digital Earth Australia (DEA) maintains and distributes collections of
satellite-derived information sourced from a growing number of different
satellite missions.

Previously, as part of DEAâ€™s Landsat Collection 2, all Landsat Analysis
Ready Data (ARD) was re-projected from native Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) to Australia Albers (EPSG:3577) and tiled to a common
$100km^2$ grid. As a result, all products (single observations and
statistical summaries), were published in a common projection and grid tiling scheme.

As part of DEA Landsat Collection 3, ARD and single-observation
derivative products are now distributed in their native UTM projection
in an effort to reduce:

* complexity of our pipelines,
* size on disk,
* lossy re-projection of data from native coordinate reference system.

To make information across Australia comparable, continental-scale, 
statistical summary products are produced in a common grid based upon 
Australian Albers (Albers Collection 3 grid). This page
describes how we developed this grid and how it differs from the
previous Australian Albers grid (Albers Collection 2 grid).

## How did we develop the new Collection 3 grid?

In developing this new grid, we had several goals:

* be compatible with the new resolution of Landsat ($30m^2$ from
   $25m^2$)
* be interoperable between both Landsat ($30m^2$) and Sentinel-2
   ($10m^2$, $20m^2$ and $60m^2$)
* have a naming convention that was non-negative, removing the need for
   plus and minus symbols that can be problematic for some software applications

The tile size is defined as $96km^2$. For Landsat, this will result
in a raster size of $3200 \times 3200 pixels$ of $30m^2$. For 
Sentinel-2, this will result in a raster size of $9600 \times 9600 pixels$ 
of $10m^2$.

For compatibility with file system and web access tools and protocols,
the grid has been defined to be non-negative, with the x00,y00 cell
located in the South-Western corner of the grid, and positive numbers
progressing Northward and Eastward.

The extent of this grid is based upon the maximal extents of:

* GDA94 / Australian Albers projection coordinate reference system
  (EPSG:3577),
* Digital Earth Australia's Landsat Collection 3,
* Digital Earth Australia's Sentinel-2 Collection,
* With a 3-cell buffer for future growth.

Shown here is an image of the new grid in EPSG:3577 projection, with tiles shown
where we expect to have land imagery available:

## How can I use this grid?

This tiling grid scheme has been used to subdivide processing and
storage of our continental products.

This tiling grid can be used as an overlay in other spatial systems to
determine the xMyN reference of a given area of interest from within a
DEA Collection 3 summary product.

Unfortunately, there is no one-to-one mapping of the new Albers
Collection 3 grid to the old Albers Collection 2 grid.
