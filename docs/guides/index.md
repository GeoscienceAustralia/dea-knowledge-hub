# Digital Earth Australia User Guides

Digital Earth Australia is an analysis platform for satellite imagery and other Earth observations.

For more information, see the [DEA website](http://www.ga.gov.au/dea).

Digital Earth Australia is currently in beta for users with accounts on the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) or the Digital Earth Australia Sandbox (see the [Setup introduction](/guides/setup/README/) page).

Data can be viewed on the interactive [Digital Earth Australia Maps](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/) platform, or accessed directly from [Amazon S3 Storage](https://data.dea.ga.gov.au).

Our OGC Web Service supporting WMS, WCS and some WPS functionality is <https://ows.services.dea.ga.gov.au/>.
