## Navigate through time and place

To navigate to a place on a map, use your mouse to zoom in and drag to move around. Or, enter an address or place into the search bar on the top left to jump directly to a location, e.g. "Warragamba Dam"

To navigate through time, drag the slider underneath **Choose a year to view** on the bottom panel. You can view data for any year for which there is coverage, from 1988 onwards.
