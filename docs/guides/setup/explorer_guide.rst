DEA Explorer
============

How do we know specifically **where** and **when** data is available? Before we start any analysis, we can answer this question by verifying existing data on the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) `Metadata Explorer <https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/>`_.

Map or Explorer?
----------------
The `DEA Metadata Explorer <https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/>`_ and
`Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Maps <https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/>`_ look similar, but they are designed for different purposes.

Use the `DEA Maps <https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/>`_ if you:

* Want to see what the product or dataset looks like and interact with the data in a map viewer display

Use the `DEA Metadata Explorer <https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/>`_ if you:

* Want to know exactly where and when you can find data

Open the DEA Metadata Explorer
------------------------------
Open https://explorer.dea.ga.gov.au/. This will display the Metadata Explorer user interface.

The DEA Metadata Explorer has four main sections.

1. **Product selection:** This shows the currently-selected product. Click the selected product name to open the products dropdown menu.
2. **Time period:** This shows the time period for which the selected product is being displayed. Click the selected time period on the grey menu bar to open the time selection dropdown menu. The blue bar chart shows the data availability over time for the product you have selected.
3. **Map display:** This shows where data is available, for the selected time and product. Blue shaded tiles indicate the presence of data.
4. **Product information:** The sidebar shows more information about the data for the selected time and product. For example, this includes how many datasets are selected, the total area of the selected datasets, and its coordinate reference system/s.
5. **Sister sites:** This menu allows you to toggle between databases to see metadata for the production and development AWS databases, as well as the production database on the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).
