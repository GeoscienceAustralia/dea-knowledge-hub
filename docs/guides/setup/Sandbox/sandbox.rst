DEA Sandbox
===========

The Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Sandbox is a learning and analysis environment
for getting started with DEA data and our `Open Data Cube`_. The Sandbox includes
sample data and Jupyter notebooks that allow you to experiment with DEAâ€™s Earth
Observation datasets and explore proof-of-concept applications.

The Sandbox is free to use, and provides you with a managed environment with 2
cores with 16GB of RAM, 10GB of storage, and regularly used Python packages
pre-installed. The Sandbox also includes Jupyter notebook user guides to help you
get started with DEA and the Open Data Cube.

Register
--------

The DEA Sandbox is free to use. Visit https://app.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au to sign up
for a new account, or sign in if you have an existing account. A verification
code will be sent to the email address you register with.

Access
------

After signing in, the DEA Sandbox will prepare a JupyterLab environment for you.
All necessary software is provided as part of this environment, so no additional
installation or configuration is required.

Navigate
--------

The JupyterLab interface consists of the main work area (right-hand panel), the
left sidebar (containing a file browser and other useful features), and a menu
bar along the top. The main work area is where Jupyter notebooks will be displayed
once opened. By default, the Launcher is displayed, which allows you to create new files.

The Sandbox comes pre-loaded with Jupyter notebooks from the `DEA Notebooks repository`_.
These notebooks are automatically updated every time you start your DEA Sandbox environment.
These include:

- `Beginner's guide`_: An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and how to load, plot and interact with DEA data

- `DEA products`_: An introduction to DEA's satellite datasets and derived products, including how to load each product

- `How-to guides`_: A recipe book of simple code examples demonstrating how to perform common analysis tasks using DEA

- `Interactive apps`_: Interactive apps and widgets that require little or no coding to run

- `Real world examples`_: More complex case studies demonstrating how DEA can be used to address real-world problems

To open an existing Jupyter notebook, double-click through the folders to find a
notebook you're interested in, then double-click the notebook to
open it in the main work area. Notebooks are indicated by the ``.ipynb`` file
extension. The JupyterLab interface also supports plain text and Markdown files.

To learn more about JupyterLab, visit the `JupyterLab Documentation`_.

Important information about The Sandbox
---------------------------------------

The Sandbox is not a production environment and should be used for protyping and exploring
DEA's data and tools. Changes made to Jupyter notebooks in the DEA Sandbox may be automatically
overwritten as part of the automatic update process, meaning any changes you make to these notebooks
may be lost. To avoid this, we recommend advanced
users use Git to clone a new copy of ``dea-notebooks`` into the Sandbox (`see guide here`_).
and the default notebooks provided. We strongly encourage you to back up your work (e.g.
to GitHub, or by downloading it to your local machine) each time you log in.

You are able to download any of the files in your Sandbox environment by right-clicking them in the left side bar
navigation panel and selecting 'download'. This download function is limited to 10 files at a time so you
may need to download your files in batches if you have more than 10.

Please note that if you have not logged into your account in the past 90 days,
we consider this account inactive and reserve the right to remove any data you
have saved in your account. Please read the DEA Sandbox disclaimer below for more information.

.. admonition:: DEA Sandbox disclaimer

   To the maximum extent permitted by law, your use of the Digital Earth Australia Sandbox (including any associated
   data or services):
   
   - Is on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis with all faults, and the Commonwealth of Australia disclaims all warranties, guarantees or representations of any kind, and

Purpose
#######

The Digital Earth Australia (DEA) Sandbox is a learning and analysis environment for getting started with DEA data and our `Open Data Cube`_. It is intended to enable you to experiment and learn how to use DEA's Earth Observation datasets and enable you to explore proof-of-concept applications that you may wish to implement in your own production environment.

Availability
############

Geoscience Australia makes no guarantee on the availability of the DEA Sandbox and may discontinue offering the DEA Sandbox without notice. We may change the features and datasets offered in response to user feedback and future assessments of budget and security.

Geoscience Australia currently has no limits on the number of persons who can create an account for the DEA Sandbox. However, there is a technical limit on the number of concurrent users who can be logged into the DEA Sandbox and if this limit is reached other users will receive an error message and be unable to login.

We may remove your files at any time without warning. If you need files hosted in the Sandbox you should download or export them regularly.

We define an account as inactive if it has not been logged into for the last 90 days and may remove the data of inactive accounts. After this data is removed, new logins will result in a fresh workspace.

In the event that a user's environment becomes unstable, it will be replaced with a fresh environment and all work/data may be lost.

As explained below, we may suspend accounts that we consider have misused the DEA Sandbox.

You can view the current system status `here`_. If you are experiencing an issue with the Sandbox that isn't identified on the status page, please submit this issue to `earth.observation@ga.gov.au`_ as we may be able to assist you to the extent we consider appropriate.
