Jupyter Notebooks
=================

Jupyter Notebooks are one of the primary tools for developing analyses with DEA.
The ability to combine code with easy-to-read Markdown makes them useful for both developing and sharing work.
Jupyter Notebooks can be used on both the `DEA Sandbox </guides/setup/Sandbox/sandbox/>`_ and the `NCI </guides/setup/NCI/README/>`_.

In addition to the documentation found in the following `DEA Notebooks User Guide </notebooks/README/>`_ section, please see the `dea-notebooks wiki on GitHub <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/dea-notebooks/wiki>`_ for more details on interacting and developing code with Jupyter Notebooks.

Opening a notebook
------------------

After launching JupterLab on the Sandbox or NCI (see the respective guides), double-click through the available folders to view notebooks (indicated by the ``.ipynb`` file extension).
Then, double-click the notebook to open it in the main work area.

Read more about opening files in the `JupyterLab Documentation`_.

Working with notebooks
----------------------

For an in-depth guide on running and editing notebooks, see the `introduction to Jupyter notebooks`_ section of the Beginner's guide.

Closing a notebook
------------------

Simply closing the notebook browser tab, will not shut down its "computational engine" (called the kernel). To shut down a kernel, go to the associated notebook and click on menu **File -> Close and Halt**. Alternatively, the Notebook Dashboard has a tab named Running that shows all the running notebooks (i.e. kernels) and allows shutting them down (by clicking on a Shutdown button).

Shutting down the Jupyter Notebook App
--------------------------------------

Closing the browser (or the tab) will not close the Jupyter Notebook App. To completely shut it down you need to close the associated terminal.
