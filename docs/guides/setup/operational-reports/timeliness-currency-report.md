# DEA Published Product Timeliness and Currency Report

This report tracks the Timeliness and Currency of DEA's published products. **Timeliness** measures how often a product's data is published on time (where 100% means 'always on time'). **Currency** indicates whether the product currently has the expected data. In this guide, you will learn how to understand and analyse this report.

## Audience and purpose

The report is designed to be used by both external and internal stakeholders. External auditors may use it to check that our product data is being published on time. Internally, we may use it to define targets that we aim to achieve each financial year. We also use it to gain valuable insights, such as to assess which products are being published reliably versus which products have had difficulties.

## Which products are included?

Only products that meet the following criteria are included in this report. This is so that the Timeliness and Currency statistics are meaningful for all the products in this report.

* **Published product** &mdash; Not a 'provisional product'.
* **Latest version** &mdash; Not an old version.
* **Regularly updated** &mdash; Not a product with 'No updates planned'.

Therefore, if you can't find a certain product in the report, it is likely that it doesn't meet one of those criteria.







$100 - (\frac{d}{365.25} \times 100)$

Why isn't a product in this table? It must be an inactive product.
